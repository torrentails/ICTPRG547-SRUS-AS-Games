# Portfolio Task 2 - Hashing

1. In your own words, describe what hashing is in general.
    
    Hashing is the process using a hash function, which maps a given input sequence of data to a consistently repeatable value. i.e. The same input data should always return the same hash value

2. Research hashing algorithms. Describe advantages and disadvantages for at least three different hashing algorithms. Please provide references for external resources. (60-100 words)

3. Provide a stepwise description (algorithmic) of a) how you can store a password safely using hashing techniques and b) how you can verify that some string is the right password? (50-90 words)

4. What is the purpose of a “salt” when hashing a password? What are the two most important properties of a “salt”? (20-40 words)

5. 
   1. Document how you installed argon2-cffi

    To install the argon2-cffi library, run the following command:
    ```bash
    $ pip install argon2-cffi
    ```
